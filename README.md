# Using-IBM-Rational-DOORs-book
This document attempts to replicate the latest ”Using IBM DOORs” book (v. 9.2), which has been replaced by the IBM Knowledge Center. It does so by using the 9.2’s book index and redirecting the user to the IBM Knowledge Center with the appropriate search query.

The pdf file is generated from the tex file using LaTeX. This can be done through the command line [1], with a GUI-software [2] or even online [3]. To make changes (e.g. to adjust it to the exact IBM Rational DOORs version your enterprise uses), just edit the tex file (Replace All "9.6.1" with "9.X.Y") and regenerate the pdf file.
